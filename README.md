# FDD EBITDA Bridge — Agent Skill

A buy-side EBITDA bridge skill built on the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format, drawn from a format seen in M&A financial due diligence.

Given a reported P&L and sell-side adjustment schedule, it evaluates each adjustment (Accept / Revise / Reject), adds buy-side positions, and exports a formatted bridge image.
